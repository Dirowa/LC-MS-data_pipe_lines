# LC-MS2 data pipeline

## the wrapper
The LC-MS2 wrapper is not an ordinary data-pipeline.
Due the the huge amounts of variables and options is an dynamic pipeline created with an shell based interface
With the Shell based interface is it possible to analyse datasets by remote computing
The wrapper can be initialised by python and supports the Windows and Linux OS. 

## datasets
with the datasets is it important to have the following items in the Sample Meta data
It requires The sample names, Batch number, injection orders and sampletypes.
incase batch is unknown run serveral PCA plots todecide or fill in 1 with all samples.
The injection order is the order from oldest to youngest when data is analysed by the LC-MS
in the sampletypes are the following information required. Blanks, Qc (or pooled samples) and samples, Internstal standards are not yet incorperated into this data-pipeline.

##databases
the databases are generated by Using MetaboShiny.
Installing MetaboShiny can be quite troublesome, for that check "Tips_for_installing_metaboshiny_on_clean_linux.R" to install dependencies for a clean Linux system
Metaboshiny parsers small public databases and generetes from the SMILE formula the monoisotopic mass.
Later in the datapipeline compounds will be filterd for the monoisotopic mass
It is also possible to parse pubchem into metadobo Shiny. For this are 2 Python scripts created
1-  PubChem_parser_to import_to_extended.py can be run and the produces files have to be manually enterd in the extended.db from metaboshiny with SQLite3 commands.
2-  pubchem_parser_slow_window&linux.py does the same as PubChem_parser_to import_to_extended.py but the output files can be imported into Metaboshiny where it calculates the monoisotopic mass from the SMILES structure
